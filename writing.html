            <span class="writing-category">Leadership</span>
            <h2>When Perfect Wasn't an Option</h2>
            <p class="writing-subtitle">Navigating complexity under constraint</p>
            
            <div class="writing-content">
                <p>I was three weeks away from our first SAP focus group when the ground shifted beneath us.</p>
                
                <p>I was serving as the Business Integration Lead for a company-wide SAP deployment at a 10,000-person professional services firm. After years of working with an outdated system, the Executive Committee had committed to a major transformation. My role was to design and facilitate a series of focus groups—showcasing new tools and processes to a pilot group of users across the organization. The goal was twofold: build buy-in for a change many employees were nervous about and gather feedback that would shape our testing, training, and deployment roadmap.</p>
                
                <p>My initial approach carefully sequenced the sessions to mirror how people actually work—following the natural project and revenue cycle from client intake through time tracking and billing. But as our first focus group launch approached, we hit a problem: the first application in that sequence, where projects are created, wouldn't be ready in time. I had a week to figure out what to do, and none of the options were great.</p>
                
                <p>We could delay all the sessions until the application was ready, but that risked a domino effect on downstream testing and training milestones we couldn't afford to miss. We could showcase the application using process wireframes instead of a live demo, but we'd already promised our pilot group they'd see the system in action—and first impressions matter, especially when people are already anxious about change. Or we could flip the script entirely: start with one of the applications that was ready—time tracking—even though it disrupted the logical flow we'd carefully designed.</p>
                
                <p>I laid out all three options for our workstream leads and executive sponsor, walking through the trade-offs, risks, and potential mitigation strategies for each. There was debate. Some wanted to wait for the "right" sequence. Others worried about losing credibility if we changed course. But I pushed for option three. Momentum mattered more than perfection here, and I knew we could make it work.</p>
                
                <div class="pull-quote">
                    "Great execution isn't about having all the pieces fall into place perfectly—it's about recognizing when the plan needs to change and solving for the outcome, not the original process."
                </div>
                
                <p>The solution wasn't just switching the order—it was redesigning the experience. I expanded the opening content to anchor participants in the overall revenue cycle process, so they understood the bigger picture even if we were starting mid-cycle. I built in review content for the later sessions to refresh everyone's memory and create continuity. What could have felt chaotic instead felt intentional.</p>
                
                <p>The focus groups succeeded. Feedback survey responses were overwhelmingly positive, and our executive sponsor was pleased we wrapped ahead of the first testing cycle. More importantly, we protected the project timeline and maintained trust with a group of employees who were already skeptical about such a massive change.</p>
                
                <p>What I learned: great execution isn't about having all the pieces fall into place perfectly. It's about recognizing when the plan needs to change, making a clear-eyed decision about trade-offs, and then solving for the outcome—not the original process.</p>
